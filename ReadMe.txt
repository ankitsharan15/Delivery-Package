We want to send our friend a package with different things.
Each thing we put inside the package has such parameters as index number, weight and cost.
The package has a weight limit.
Our goal is to determine which things to put into the package so that the total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible.
We would prefer to send a package which weights less in case there is more than one package with the same price.
(We have taken some input stored in packageproblem.txt file as well)

Lets solve our problem with a JAVA program!!!!
